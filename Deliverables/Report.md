What are the challenges of this problem?

    Scraping content from a website sequentially is a slow task because you want to set a timer in order to have the website not block your IP address.
    So the self-imposed timer will often be the main bottle-neck.

    However, given a list of websites and access to a cluster with many nodes, we can have them divide and conquer the list of websites to scrape, each with their self-imposed timer.
