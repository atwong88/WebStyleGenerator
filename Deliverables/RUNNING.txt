First time set-up:
1. Type `python -m venv app-env` in the main repo. We used anaconda as our default python, but other versions > 3.5 should work as well.
2. See SFU 732 instructions for installing PySpark and Cassandra on your server

Launching the web application:
1. If you are on a windows server, type `app-env\Scripts\activate.bat`
   Otherwise you can type `app-env\Scripts\activate.sh`
2. Then install the required libraries from the "requirements.txt" by typing:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. You can now run the web application by typing:
   `python run.py`
